### Last day before the big show!

Every video player solution I tried to run on the second Pi, running Raspbian, did not work.
Then it occured to me: why am I not running a media player OS like [Raspbmc](http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=Raspbmc)?

I reformat the second Pi's SD card and install Raspbmc.
