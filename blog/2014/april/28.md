### Design Issues

After confirming that everything was working with the Pi connected and running off the Create, I pulled down the latest files to the Pi, and redirected the webserver to host them. A new surprise, the CSS was not rendering correctly on the Pi's webserver.

This is what it looks like.
<a href=""><img src="" height="200"></a>

This is what it <em>should</em> look like.
<a href=""><img src="" height="200"></a>

I confirmed that the CSS link was valid in the HTML, and that all the file permissions were correct on the pi:

<img src="" height="100">

After reading a little more into <a href="https://code.google.com/p/webiopi/">Webiopi</a>, I think I'll need to go with <a href="http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/light-webserver">Lighttpd</a>.
