### Making connections

Web to Radio Shack and bought a 25-pin male serial solder connector, to plug directly into the Create's Cargo Bay Connector. I then solder 4 jumper cables to the connector, for data, ground, and power.

Leaving the power off for now (and the RPi plugged into AC power) to test, I connected the other three cables to the RPi's GPIO pins for ground, UART TX, and UART RX.
