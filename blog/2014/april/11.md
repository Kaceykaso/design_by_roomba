# Init > Design by Roomba

## Project

As my senior <a href="http://visarts.ucsd.edu/icam-interdisciplinary-computing-and-arts-major">ICAM</a> project at <a href="http://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, I am designing a web app to control a <a href="http://store.irobot.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2586252">Roomba Create</a> that will draw crowdsourced pictures. Users will enter simple commands (forward, backward, left, right) via a web form that will be captured and parsed by a webserver, running on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> connected to the Roomba, and then turned into serial commands to be carried out. The Roomba will be equiped with an arm holding a Sharpie marker, as it runs over construction paper.

This project will initially be presented and demonstrated at UCSD's Best of ICAM show in June 2014.

### Objective

Give a literal example of 'design by committee' and how it can, and cannot, work to get a specific job done. Does having too many managers hinder progress, or can collaboration fuel greater results?
