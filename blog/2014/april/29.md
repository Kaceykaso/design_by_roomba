### Design Decisions

Got some spiffy 'Dance, Dance' action going; correlating with the 5 most recent directions in the click history (being saved to a txt file).

Tested out the bar graph percentage idea, and decided I didn't like it. The bars would grow and shrink as votes were tallied. I like the idea of the bars only going up, not down, when voting is happening.

Also added colors to the graph, based on the highest (winning) and lowest (losing) directions.
