### MOAR Research

There seems to be two ways to connect/control the iRobot Create, which is NOT the case for Roombas:

 - 7-pin mini din (usual serial most people use)
 - 25-pin Cargo Bay Connector
 
Reading through the <a href="http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf">iRobot documentation</a>, the Cargo Bay connector has references to 5V power, which the RPi needs/uses. Most Roomba hackers are forced to connect a convertor or voltage regulator to the mini din serial, in order to power a RPi off of it. Looking into more hacks and demos using specificallhy Creates instead of Roombas, it comes to my attention that most hackers still use the mini din. 

It seems to me that a ribbon cable could just be connected directly from the Cargo Bay Connector directly to the RPi's 25-pin GPIO headers. So why isn't this being done? Will need to test this...
