Spent ALL day yesterday failing to build a 5V, 1A regulator. I came home earlier in the week to find my Pi and Create dead, after thinking I had solved my power issue. Turns out I had not.

The 5V battery power pin I was using on the Create is regulated (good), but its only ~0.5A, too low for the Pi. The RPi will run for a time, but then shut down. The other power pins are unregulated 10-12V (bad) at 1.5A (good). So I needed to build a 5V/1A regulator, which seemed easy enough judging from this YouTube video:

So I took another trip to Fry's (might as well surrender my paycheck to them each week), and bought:

 - ~~1x 5V 1A regulator~~
 - 2x 10uF capacitor
 
**Edit: Apparently, what I thought was a regulator was actually an <a href="http://www.newark.com/nte-electronics/nte198/transistor-bipolar-npn-400v-30a/dp/76R0916">transistor</a>. Drive back to Frys to return it and actually get a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062599">regulator</a>.
