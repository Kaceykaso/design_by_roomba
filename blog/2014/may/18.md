### Bob Ross speaks!

Improved the Bob Ross Mode with better chat features:

 - If no there's record of a conversation, introduce yourself, say a random Bob Ross quote:

 - When the user enters something in, parse it, compare against predetermined keywords, and then respond with a confirmation.
 - If last user response contains "no", then carry on.
 - If last user response contains "yes", confirm and execute, also giving another random Bob Ross quote:

### Weirdness

After I get the frontend working great locally on my laptop, I push everything up to GitHub, and then pull it back down on my RPi. I start the webserver on the Pi, and on my laptop can see the page, but weirdly, the form is not submitting properly. PHP is up and running, the page is rendered, and any PHP code is executed, but any code that is triggered by the form submission does not fire.

I check all the webserver's install files on the Pi....everythings good. I check all the necessary PHP files...everythings good. After doing a couple hours of research and adding in various lines to Lighttpd's config file, I am no better off.

Not wanting to waste anymore time, and also because my head is killing me at this point, I uninstall Lighttpd and install Apache. Hopefully Apache will not be so fat as to make me regret this...
