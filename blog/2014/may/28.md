### Logic

Things that still need to be done/fleshed out:
 - Storing parsed keyword for use on confirmation
  - Entering "yes/no" by themselves (not confirming anything) does not; checks against last 2 lines written?
 - Stores more than 1 parsed keyword to queue up drawings
 - Scripts for drawing a tree and a cloud
 - Checks to see if the Create is still drawing if the user enters something, so that commands do not get lost
  - Give feedback if Create is still drawing, "Hang on a second..."

Things that I would like to do:
 - Be able to pass variables to the python scripts for sizing and repeats, "Draw 2 big circles!"


### Permissions

So, yea, my problems yesterday with the scripts not running were due to permissions...again. Specifically, the python folder:

```
$ sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /home/pi/design_by_roomba/python
$ ls -la
4 drwxrwxrwx 2 www-data www-data  4096 May 28 22:37 python
```
That being fixed, the scripts are running from the webpage again.
