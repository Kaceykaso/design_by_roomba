### Logic

Things that still need to be done/fleshed out:
 - Storing parsed keyword for use on confirmation
  - Entering "yes/no" by themselves (not confirming anything) does not; checks against last 2 lines written?
 - Stores more than 1 parsed keyword to queue up drawings
 - Scripts for drawing a tree and a cloud
 - Checks to see if the Create is still drawing if the user enters something, so that commands do not get lost
  - Give feedback if Create is still drawing, "Hang on a second..."

Things that I would like to do:
 - Be able to pass variables to the python scripts for sizing and repeats, "Draw 2 big circles!"
