### Finally, a break through!

Just when I was beginning to think I would never understand this iRobot interface and get this working, I found the most helpful documentation ever:

<http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~zduric/cs101/pmwiki.php/Main/Installation>

An upper division CS course at GMU teachs students how to create and operate iRobot Creates, but more importantly, they made a fantastic create.py script and documentation! This was the bridge I was looking for, to make the connection between Create's serial interface and the RPi.

Still utilizing Pyserial, copy this [create.py](../../../../gh-pages/python/create.py) script in the "/dev" directory of your RPi (adjacent the Serial directory), and write your Python script importing the two:

```python
import serial;
import create;

robot = create.Create("/dev/ttyUSB0");

```
A full API doc, explaining each method and its possible parameters, can be found here:

Video proof of the [little test script I wrote](../../../../gh-pages/python/test2.py), uploaded to the RPi, and then ran remotely:
