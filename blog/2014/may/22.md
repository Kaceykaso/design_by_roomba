### Adding shapes

Wrote Python scripts for a [triangle](../../../python/triangle.py) (12" equilateral), [square](../../../python/square.py) (12"), and a [cirlce](../../../python/circle.py) (12" diameter); to be triggered by the PHP method when a user tells the RossBot to draw something. Each script records the current time and position of the RossBot before and after drawing the thing.

Eventually, I think I'd like to make these scripts into methods, so I can pass a multipler parameter into it. That way, when a user tells RossBot to draw a thing, RossBot can ask "Big, small, or really BIG?". Based on that, call something like:
```python
really_big = default*4

drawCircle(really_big)
```
