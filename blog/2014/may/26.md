### Switch gears

I put the circuit board mini-project on hold for the time being, since I'm under a deadline, and put the components back on a breadboard hooked up to the Create. After verifying that that worked as it did before, I booted the Pi back up and continued troubleshooting on the PHP to Python issue.

Following this [tutorial](http://raspberrywebserver.com/cgiscripting/setting-up-nginx-and-uwsgi-for-cgi-scripting.html), it looks like I need uWSGI to run Python from Nginx. But I get an error, saying the URL is empty, when I actually try to download the plugin:

```
$ curl http://uwsgi.it/install | bash -s cgi /home/pi/uwsgi
```
After looking at another [forum post](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=15370) I try to install via PIP:

```
$ sudo apt-get install pip
$ sudo pip install uwsgi
```
But unfortunately, even PIP won't install. I found another [handy blog post](http://jeffskinnerbox.wordpress.com/linux-python-packages-for-my-raspberry-pi/) full of useful RPi commands, including an alternative PIP install command. But before I do that, I decide to run some updates:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo easy_install -U distribute
```
I then run the PIP install:

```
$ sudo apt-get install pyton-pip
```
This get stuck at: 
```
 Running setup.py install for uwsgi
```

### Starting over...yet again

I decide to start from a clean slate, again following this [forum post](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=15370). ~~I first run the following, removing all Python packages:~~
```
$ sudo apt-get remove .*python.*
```
~~Then I reinstall Python from the source with custom libraries:~~
```
$ sudo -s
$ apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libbz2-dev
$ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tar.bz2
$ tar xjf Python-2.7.5.tar.bz2
$ cd Python-2.7.5
$ ./configure --enable-shared; make; make install;
$ ldconfig
```
This royally f*@#%d up my RPi!

### Abort!

After finding that I cannot reinstall/uninstall/force install Python, which I absolutely need, I am left with only on choice: wipe and reinstall [Raspian](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/).
