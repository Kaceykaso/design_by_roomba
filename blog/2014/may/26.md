### Switch gears

I put the circuit board mini-project on hold for the time being, since I'm under a deadline, and put the components back on a breadboard hooked up to the Create. After verifying that that worked as it did before, I booted the Pi back up and continued troubleshooting on the PHP to Python issue.

Following this [tutorial](http://raspberrywebserver.com/cgiscripting/setting-up-nginx-and-uwsgi-for-cgi-scripting.html), it looks like I need uWSGI to run Python from Nginx. But I get an error, saying the URL is empty, when I actually try to download the plugin:

```
curl http://uwsgi.it/install | bash -s cgi /home/pi/uwsgi
```
After looking at another [forum post](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=15370) I try to install via PIP:

```
sudo apt-get install pip
sudo pip install uwsgi
```
But unfortunately, even PIP won't install. I found another [handy blog post](http://jeffskinnerbox.wordpress.com/linux-python-packages-for-my-raspberry-pi/) full of useful RPi commands, including an alternative PIP install command. But before I do that, I decide to run some updates:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo easy_install -U distribute
```
