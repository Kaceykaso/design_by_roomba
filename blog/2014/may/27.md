### I need more power, captain!

I woke up this morning to find my Create, RPi, everything dead and turned off. Still plugged in though. Somehow it drained completely, while sitting there doing nothing, plugged into power. This means the RPi and it's 5V regulator is drawing more power, even idle, than the battery can recharge while plugged into the wall.

I unplugged and plugged it back into the wall, and everything came back to life. I hit the webpage once booted, and run my test command again to make sure we're still good from last night....and nothing.

I try the imperial march script....nothing. Both still run if called from the command line, just not from the PHP. I look up the error log:

```
[Tue May 27 01:17:34 2014] [notice] Apache/2.2.22 (Debian) PHP/5.4.4-14+deb7u9 configured -- resuming normal operations
```
The last entry is from 1am this morning, and nothing about rebooting just now, or any new errors written just now when the script didn't run.

I run through all the permissions commands I ran yesterday on the directories, files, and serial ports. I hit the webpage again and give the test command. Nothing.

Then RossBot dies again.

So not only is power going to be a big problem, I need to figure out what Apache changed, or 'configured', when it crashed. I may need to redo the SD card again.

Boo.
