### Time Wasted

Spent 6 hours today trying to implement a JQuery timer. Yea, sounds easy; until I realized my PHP form constantly submitting and refreshing the page rendered the timer useless, since it was constantly being reset.

The idea was to give the users feedback as to how long they have to get votes in, with a dynamic timer counting down. But in order to do that, it needs to be in Javascript (client side). All my tallying and recording of votes, checks, and other feedback is in PHP (server side).

So I spent way too much time trying to rewrite all my code in Javascript, but it never really worked right. Plus, I realized, yet again, that the tallying and recording votes NEEDS to be on the server if I want it to work across multiple different IP's and have the same feedback.

Oh well. Ctrl Z. Ctrl Z. Ctrl Z...
