### More troubleshooting

Well, over one hurdle and on to another! I got the PHP form submitting and running properly, but the line executing the Python script is not working.

Currently, I have:
```php
exec('python python/imperial_march.py');
```

And have tried:
```php
system('python python/imperial_march.py');
```

Perhaps it doesn't like going into a folder? Nope.<br>
Look at error log:
```
2014/05/20 20:10:40 [error] 32132#0: *1 FastCGI sent in stderr: "PHP message: PHP Notice:  Undefined index...
```

Oh.<br>
Research calling _Python from PHP via FastCGI_...[find this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7048057/running-python-through-fastcgi-for-nginx). I need something else to run Python.
