### More troubleshooting

Well, over one hurdle and on to another! I got the PHP form submitting and running properly, but the line executing the Python script is not working.

Currently, I have:

```python
exec('python python/imperial_march.py');
```

And have tried:

```python
system('python python/imperial_march.py');
```

Perhaps it doesn't like going into a folder?
