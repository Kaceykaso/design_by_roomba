Design by Roomba
================
Design by Committee by Design

Roomba draws crowdsourced picture over a period of time; based on a series of commands submitted through a web app, and received by a Raspberry Pi (or Arduino) attached to the Roomba. Picture will eventually be created during a gallery exhibition.
Commands are simplistic: right turn, left turn, forward, backward.

Expected outcome: Since user cannot see the Roomba, the picture will be rather chaotic.
Ideal outcome: There are at least some recognizable patterns in the picture.

Optional Phase 2: Set up dropcam overlooking Roomba, with feed displayed on web app side-by-side with command submission form, so users get real time feedback.

Optional Phase 3: Add color; have multiple arms with different color sharpies attached, that lift and set down by servos. User can choose color in addition to directional command on website.

Objective: Prove design by committee, or large group collaboration, does or does not work. Prove “too many masters (or managers)” does or does deter progress.

Optional: Through Google Analytics on web app, find possible patterns in commands coming from certain countries, devices, OS’s, etc.

Observations
<li>Does lag, if any, create a significant problem in the design?</li>
<li>Does the Roomba get overloaded if too many commands are sent?</li>
<li>How do you reset the Roomba when it hits a wall, so that it doesn’t interrupt the design?</li>
<li>Does the Raspberry Pi/Arduino being on and constantly checking the web significantly affect the Roomba’s battery life?</li>
