## Concept

Design by Committee by Design

Roomba draws crowdsourced picture over a period of time; based on a series of commands submitted through a web app, and received by a Raspberry Pi ~~(or Arduino)~~ attached to the Roomba. Picture will be created during a gallery exhibition over an hour or two, with users at laptop/tablet stations, sending commands via the website.<br>
Commands are simplistic: right turn, left turn, forward, backward.
